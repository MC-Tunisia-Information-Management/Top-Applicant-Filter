# Top-Applicant-Filter
The "Top Applicant Filter Code" script iterates through specified monthly sheets to count occurrences of applicants' names in column B. It stores these counts in an object and identifies the top three most frequently occurring names. These names are then written to specific cells in the "Welcome" sheet, prefixed with ranking numbers (#1, #2, #3). This script effectively identifies and displays the most frequently appearing applicant names across multiple monthly sheets within a Google Sheets document, aiding in tracking and analyzing applicant popularity or engagement over time.
